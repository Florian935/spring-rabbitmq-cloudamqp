# Spring Boot with RabbitMQ on AMQP Cloud

## Goal

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to `produce and consume messages` on the `AMQP Cloud`.

You just need to register on the AMQP Cloud, create a spring rabbitMQ producer and consumer, and configure your credentials.

This project is the demo of how to do that.

There is a `spring_rabbitmq_cloudampq_producer` package which produce in a queue on the `AMQP Cloud`.
The `spring_rabbitmq_cloudampq_consumer` package consume the produced messages on the `AMQP Cloud`.
